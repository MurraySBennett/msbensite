# msbensite — agent entry point

Personal site

## Resume here

If you are a new session with no prior context, read in this order and stop
when you can state the next action:

1. `WORK.md` — the live work state: where things left off (`## Now`)
   and the open tasks by stream. **This alone is usually enough.**
2. `git log --oneline -10` and `git status --short` — what actually happened
   last, and what is dirty right now.
3. Only if the live state names them: the specific files it names.

Do **not** read the whole repo or the full `docs/` tree to "get up to speed."
If the live state is not enough to act, that is a defect in the live state —
say so and fix it first.

There is exactly one live state file for this repo: `WORK.md`. Do not create a
second one, a dated copy, or a `-v2`. Overwrite it; git history is the
archive. `docs/agents/CURRENT_WORK.md` is an unfilled PM/worker template, not
a record — do not route through it. Maintain `WORK.md` as you
work; the conventions — streams, horizons, the session-end rewrite — are in
the global working agreement, not restated here.
