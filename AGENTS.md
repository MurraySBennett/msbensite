# msbensite — agent entry point

Personal site

## Resume here

If you are a new session with no prior context, read in this order and stop
when you can state the next action:

1. `docs/agents/CURRENT_WORK.md` — the live state. **This alone is usually enough.**
2. `git log --oneline -10` and `git status --short` — what actually happened
   last, and what is dirty right now.
3. Only if the live state names them: the specific files it names.

Do **not** read the whole repo or the full `docs/` tree to "get up to speed."
If the live state is not enough to act, that is a defect in the live state —
say so and fix it first.

There is exactly one live state file for this repo: `docs/agents/CURRENT_WORK.md`.
Do not create a second one, a dated copy, or a `-v2`. Overwrite it; git
history is the archive.
